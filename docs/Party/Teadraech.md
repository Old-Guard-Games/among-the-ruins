# Teadraech

## At a glance
- **Heritage:** Tessian
- **Background:** Sellsword
- **Look:** Weathered

## Description
Teadraech is rangy and slightly tall, his red hair is cut oddly with lines of exposed scalp throughout and matted with dirt and plant matter, much the same as his chest length beard wrought with small braids of beads, bone, and other charms.  His skin is covered in whorls of woad blue tattoos in runic pattersn and stylistic representations of plants and animals.  His cloak has the look of once having been an entirely different article of cloathing though the feathers, fur, and vines and layers of leather, hide, and cloth patches.

## Vice
**Stupor**
A follower of the Old Gods of Earth and Stone, Teadraech uses various substances to either open his consciousness further to their constant whispers, or alternately to seek a reprieve from them.
