## Details
### Long Way Down
The party left the burial chamber and its empty sarcophagii and headed down what used to be a staircase, but if there was ever a ceiling it collapsed some time ago. Zaph took point as the party descended. The deeper the party went, the darker the gloom above seemed, and although they were in a cavernous space, there seemed to be almost no reverberation, as though the stone walls were made of cloth.

Suddenly, Zaph noticed sudden shift in the light from behind him (cast by the alchemical torch Talgren gave to Gitash), and he turned to see that the torch was lying on the stones. There was no sign of either Gitash or Talgren. He was understandably distressed.

Teadraech reached out his senses into the web of life to determine if his companions were still alive. He confirmed that they were, but in so doing, drew the attention of the thing which had taken them. His mind filled with an ever-repeating fragment of speech in some language he did not know, though it sounded harsh and sinister. Thinking was difficult, so he shook his head and told Matthias and Zaph that the others were alive, but moving quickly away from their location. He asserted that the party needed to move, not knowing what danger had stolen them away. They would need to take care of themselves.

They continued downward for some time. After a while, they began to hear the sound of flowing water, faintly at first, but growing louder as they continued to descend until eventually the long-ruined staircase gave way to a cave passage leading still deeper. However, there was also a hewn stone corridor off to the side. Teadraech, with Zaph's help, searched the area for some sign of which way their quarry had gone. He found drops of dried blood, and occasional smears, on the wall of the tunnel leading down. He also reflected on how the deeper they went, the further they traveled into the sway of the remnants of civilizations long past into ruin.

### Rapid Struggle
They followed the natural passage, which opened into a larger tunnel through which the rapids of an underground river flowed. As they took stock of their environs, the black whispers in Teadraech's mind grew louder, and he suddenly realized that he could hear no other sound. He turned to see that Zaph had hold of something that looked like a rope made of bandages, and that there were tendrils of cloth reaching for him. 

He took his torch and, acting on instinct, thrust it into the center of what he recognized as a mummified torso. The dry cloth wrappings caught fire quickly, and the thing grabbed him with burning cloth tentacles, pulling him in toward itself. 

Zaph unslung his blunderbuss and, dodging through the whipping cloth, got in close enough to shoot the thing in the chest, point blank. As soon as the gun went off, the guardian imploded upon itself, dragging Zaph and Teadraech both, and slamming them together. The sudden pressure shift was enough to extinguish the fire. Strewn about the ground below where it had been were warped chunks of metal which they recognized as the remnants of those silencing bells Gitash had shown them. Once they had collected themselves and calmed a bit from the fight, Matthias led them downstream following the debtor's trail.

### The Dead Speak in Flashes
After a while, the rapids grew deeper and wider, and the water flowed less violently. They came upon a stone dock with a single boat tied to it, though dragged up onto the stone shore of the cavern. Beyond, they could see a small hut with its door open, light spilling out to meet theirs, revealing a pool of some dark liquid in the doorway.

Matthias drew closer to investigate the hut, and found the corpse of a dead trau inside. Based on the amount of blood on the ground and the palor of the corpse, the fellow appeared to have been exsanguinated.  Having not learned his lesson last time, he decided to brush up against the veil between life and death in an effort to try and speak with the departed soul of this man. He held in his mind a will to learn anything about the man they followed.

He saw a dim vision in his mind of a stranger approaching, though Matthias recognized this stranger as the debtor his church was looking for. The man was heading for a waterfall. The Trau caretaker knew the way, and told him. Matthias noted this in his mind and concentrated his thoughts on what befell the caretaker.

Immediately, the vision changed.  The stranger pulled out a small clay vial and handed it to the caretaker in thanks before leaving. It was clear that several hours, or perhaps longer, had passed. The caretaker poured the contents of the vial onto the back of his hand, licked a small bit of the powder, then snorted the rest with both nostrils. He sank to the floor as the drug took effect. His last sight before darkness took him was a dark figure with shifting outlines standing in the doorway.

He briefly regained consciousness, just long enough to notice he was hanging upside-down. The air was full of the scent of iron, and as he looked up...no, down, he saw a dark pool growing beneath him and his back felt wet. But it was only a moment, and after that, he knew no more.

Matthias formulated the feelings and desire for what he really wanted, more about the situation in these watery caves.  The spirit showed him a series of flashes in which the caretaker replaced and reset traps, wards, and other protections against the disturbance of the Witch Kings. Someone had been consistently and systematically disabling these protections. He had a sense of some small amount of time passing. Weeks maybe? Matthias thanked the spirit of the Trau and withdrew his consciousness from the veil.

He led the group further downstream, and although the river ran through a submerged area the party had to navigate around, Matthias's vision had shown the way.

### No Quarter
The mist from the waterfall hung like dense fog in the air. Although the concussive force of the water crashing down at the bottom of the cliff ahead was a steady rumble in his chest, Matthias heard no sound of it. As he looked down, he saw why. Tom Jenning, the debtor they'd come to collect, was suspended in the mist by ancient gauze wrapped around his throat and limbs. Two guardians pulled his limbs in either direction, clearly intending to pull him apart. Although no sound escaped the aura of the guardians' bells, Jenning's face was contorted in an agonized scream.

Uttering a prayer to Maloch, Matthias leapt down. The debts on his skin grew heavy, and he fell faster as they pulled him down. However, just before landing, his burden was lifted just  enough to avoid injury as he tackled the righthand guardian.

Zaph grumbled about not having fancy gravity powers, and unwound the rope and grapnel from his pack. He quickly rappelled down, though his sprained shoulder gave him some trouble, and he landed slightly off balance. Still resolute, he drew his axe and began fending off the left guardian's tendrils, catching them on the axe and working to tangle it up.  He was able to hold it mostly at bay, but in response it reached out still more musty wrappings and began to squeeze his neck, the pressure increasing slowly and constantly.

Teadraech, still on the ledge above the falls, drew his bow. He took aim at the cloth ropes tightening around Zaph's throat. As he released the arrow, the dark will behind the black speech in his mind caused his bow arm to twitch just barely, but enough that the arrow sank into Zaph's neck, pinning the cloth wrappings there as well.

Meanwhile, down below, Matthias's tattoos began to glow faintly golden as he drew his fist back. Then, with sudden force, he slammed it into where the guardian's face would be if it had one. His divinely imbued fist broke through the shell of magic holding the guardian together, and it immediately imploded around his arm. The bells, warped by the sudden force, left long gashes along his arm, but in his fervor he felt little pain.

Zaph was starting to see dark spots dancing before him, and although he was partially obscured by the mist at the base, Teadraech could tell the fighter was in serious trouble. He took a moment to steady himself and drew again, this time aiming for the remaining guardian's head. A tremor came over him at the moment he released, and Jenning's side sprouted a feathered shaft.

Matthias ran and leapt at the remaining guardian with a flying boot. It crashed down and skidded across the rough stone floor, its wrappings unraveling. With a silent WHOOMP, it, too, imploded. He hurried over to Zaph. "Your work is not yet done, your debts not yet repaid," he said as he tore the arrow from his throat. He placed his hand over the wound and closed his eyes in prayer to Maloch. Golden light bled between his fingers and when he removed them, a crimson tattoo of sorts lay across the place where the arrow had been.
  
Matthias coughed as a sharp stab of pain struck his own throat. He first expected to be bleeding as he took Zaph's wound onto himself, but instead he found only the raised skin of a nearly identical tattoo to the one Zaph had just gained. Both of them were even more firmly in Maloch's debt.
