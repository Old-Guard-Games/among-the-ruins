# Among the Ruins
#### *A Blades Against Darkness (mostly) campaign*

This is intended to be a companion to our group's Blades Against Darkness campaign. We have stitched together bits and pieces of various versions of the game released so far, so at times you may notice things which don't quite sound right. That's because we're a group that just can't keep from poking, prodding, and tinkering with any game system.

We make no guarantees that this site will see regular updates, nor that it will be easily understandable to anyone who isn't part of the game. Expect [[links]] to pages which don't exist, incomplete descriptions of factions, characters, jobs, and who knows what else. Maybe those blanks will be filled eventually, or maybe not. It'll be a surprise!

The design is likewise in flux. Don't mind weird pink banners or other such things. They'll look good Eventuallyâ„¢

For our players, please feel free to point out any errors you find. For visitors, we hope you enjoy your time Among the Ruins.
