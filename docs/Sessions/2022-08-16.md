- Gitash joined "to get out of town for a while"

## Job
[[7 - The Debt Must Be Paid]]

- Took job to track down debtor, Tom Jenning
	- Mummy dust dealer, recently lost supply, nobody wants to work with him
	- Fled below to avoid capture and thus debtor's prison, also hoping to find a new source of dust
- Went down below
	- Gitash knew the area, found a recently plundered sarcophagus
	- " found cut tripwire with clapperless bells, enchanted to provide silence
	- He could tell that something was in the area, hunting.
	- Path led to a room which was heavily eroded, with barely any floor, sloped and slippery toward a pool of unknown depths, with things below, swimming in the motes of light from the alchemical torch
		- Talgren used pitons and rope to forge a safe course across, with Gitash using the enchanted silent bell to prevent the hammering to draw attention
	- Beyond that, the corridors sloped downward, and before long the party was wading in hip-chest deep water. 
		- Piles of stones shaken loose from the ceiling over the years by the volcano's vibrations littered the floor, and blocked off side passages. 
		- Another passage seemed to travel roughly parallel to the flooded one, but the mouth was blocked by heavy stones.
			- Using his greataxe and its recently reinforced haft as leverage, Zaph made an opening in the stones.
		- The passage led to a cavern full of stone coffins and sarcophagi, but the air was thick with a miasma of mold spores and other unhealthy things.
			- Teadraech called upon the spirit of the vulture to summon mucousy coating for their faces to protect against the unwholesome air
		- The cavern gave way to a tunnel leading to a smaller but more carefully wrought chamber holding only one sarcophagus, very recently disturbed. 
			- Matthias sensed a malevolent spiritual energy in the area, and reached out to it, hoping to glean information about either their quarry or the location of their pursuer(s). Instead, he gave far more information than he gained, and the guardians of these watery tombs are coming.
