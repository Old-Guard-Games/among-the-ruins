Gitash knew of Jenning as a mummy dust dealer. Rumor was that his supply dried up and he was an untrustworthy bastard. Nobody wanted to work with him. Some said he fled to the tunnels below Ironwood to find his own source of dust more than to avoid his obligation. Gitash, being a Trau who grew up beneath the ruins of Agartha, knew the area. He led the way through the increasingly damp tunnels as the party descended. Near the entrance to this branch of the city's aquifer, called Bedan's Cry, they found the first sign of Jenning - a cut tripwire. The limp cord was strung with dull iron bells, engraved with ancient runes, lacking clappers. They worked together, searching the area for distinct signs of Jenning's passage. To help in this, Talgren produced an alchemical torch, which glowed with a pulsing light, shedding motes of arcane luminance which drifted to the ground like dust before passing through without touching it. Off to the side of one of the nearby tunnels they found a small alcove with an open sarcophagus. The scraps of decaying linen and the scraped layer of dust on the ground told them that this tomb had recently been robbed. Gitash's senses built from years of living among the restless remains of the Witch Kings' waning empire warned him that their presence here was not likely to go unnoticed. However, he and his new companions had a mission. They followed the small signs their quarry had made through the network of cave passages and hewn tunnels - a disturbed pile of scree here, places where the algae had been smeared by a hand on the wall. It led to a heavily eroded chamber, with a pool taking up nearly the entire area. What little floor that remained was steeply sloped and slick with moisture and mold. Gitash held the alchemical torch over the water, letting the glowing motes drift down and down into its depths. Either the luminant energy faded, or the water's murk overcame the glow. Whichever was the case, it was clear that the pool was of indeterminable depth, and that there were things swimming in it. Some fish of course, but other shapes moved as well, with little discernable form. They resolved not to swim across. Talgren came prepared for difficult caving, and began unpacking rope and pitons. He began to hammer a piton into the wall, but Gitash asked him to wait a moment. He withdrew one of the iron bells from the tripwire. He explained that, when activated by certain kinds of motion, they create an area of silence. He shook it vigorously and just like he said, there was suddenly no sound in the room. Talgren silently made a path of pitons along the wall, tying rope to them as he went to create a handhold. It took time, but they all made it safely across. The tunnels and passages beyond the flooded room sloped still downward. The deeper they went, the wetter the tunnels became, until eventually they were wading through waist-deep water. It was rough going as they slowly picked their way along the floor strewn with hidden chunks of stone shaken loose from the ceiling from past seismic events, which were not uncommon underground at the base of the active volcano. Zaph noticed light shining through the cracks in one of the passage's walls, higher up. A brief investigation told him that the light he'd seen was actually reflected light from their torches, and that the cracked wall was in fact a pile of rubble blocking a second, parallel tunnel, but high enough as to be free of water. Using his massive axe for leverage, he cleared enough of the rubble to allow the group to gain the upper passage. As they traveled, they periodically came across small openings into the flooded tunnel they'd been in, so it was clear they were still moving in the right direction, assuming Jenning had gone this way. The passage led to a cavern with many alcoves carved into the walls, in which lay stone coffins and more ornate containers of internment. The air was foul, and there was a thick miasma of mold spores and other unwholesome things. Teadraech reached out to the spirits of the area around Ironwood, and to the spirit of the vulture specifically. In exchange for a promise to provide an offering of aged meat to the its children on the surface, the spirit granted a boon to him and his allies. A thick mucous coating coalesced from the are around each of their faces, covering them in a thick, protective goo. They were able to pass through into the passage beyond, and a quick glance around assured them that they were still following Tom's trail. The natural passage gave way to a corridor paved in cracked stone bricks which in turn ended in a rectangular room. The worked stone was clearly in a state of disrepair, but they could see hints of its past glory. Fragments of stone frieze lay on the ground, eroding statues lay broken on the floor. But even still, it was not hard to imagine this place as an opulent burial chamber. For that is what it was. It held only a single sarcophagus, standing open and empty like the one before. And again the signs indicated that it was only recently plundered. As the party had a look around the chamber, Matthias became aware of a malevolent spiritual energy pulsing near the edge of his senses. Believing this energy to be connected to the hunter Gitash mentioned before, he decided to try and communicate with it and perhaps gain some knowledge of their quarry, or at least the location of the hunter itself. He reached out his mind to the malevolence, and did indeed gain some insight into the situation. What he felt and saw confirmed that they were indeed on Jenning's trail. However, as is often the case when one stares into the abyss, it stared back into Mathias, and he knew with complete certainty that he had its attention. It would be coming for them.","title":"August 16, 2022"},{"location":"1%20-%20Sessions/2022-08-16/#august-16-2022","text":"","title":"August 16, 2022"},{"location":"1%20-%20Sessions/2022-08-16/#the-job","text":"The Debt Must Be Paid The party took a job from the House of Maloch to track down a debtor, Tom Jenning, who had defaulted on his debt and fled to escape his agreement of endenture.

Zaph took point as the party descended. The deeper the party went, the darker the gloom above seemed, and although they were in a cavernous space, there seemed to be almost no reverberation, as though the stone walls were made of cloth. Suddenly, Zaph noticed sudden shift in the light from behind him (cast by the alchemical torch Talgren gave to Gitash), and he turned to see that the torch was lying on the stones. There was no sign of either Gitash or Talgren. He was understandably distressed. Teadraech reached out his senses into the web of life to determine if his companions were still alive. He confirmed that they were, but in so doing, drew the attention of the thing which had taken them. His mind filled with an ever-repeating fragment of speech in some language he did not know, though it sounded harsh and sinister. Thinking was difficult, so he shook his head and told Matthias and Zaph that the others were alive, but moving quickly away from their location. He asserted that the party needed to move, not knowing what danger had stolen them away. They would need to take care of themselves. They continued downward for some time. After a while, they began to hear the sound of flowing water, faintly at first, but growing louder as they continued to descend until eventually the long-ruined staircase gave way to a cave passage leading still deeper. However, there was also a hewn stone corridor off to the side. Teadraech, with Zaph's help, searched the area for some sign of which way their quarry had gone. He found drops of dried blood, and occasional smears, on the wall of the tunnel leading down. He also reflected on how the deeper they went, the further they traveled into the sway of the remnants of civilizations long past into ruin. Rapid Struggle \u00b6 They followed the natural passage, which opened into a larger tunnel through which the rapids of an underground river flowed. As they took stock of their environs, the black whispers in Teadraech's mind grew louder, and he suddenly realized that he could hear no other sound. He turned to see that Zaph had hold of something that looked like a rope made of bandages, and that there were tendrils of cloth reaching for him. He took his torch and, acting on instinct, thrust it into the center of what he recognized as a mummified torso. The dry cloth wrappings caught fire quickly, and the thing grabbed him with burning cloth tentacles, pulling him in toward itself. Zaph unslung his blunderbuss and, dodging through the whipping cloth, got in close enough to shoot the thing in the chest, point blank. As soon as the gun went off, the guardian imploded upon itself, dragging Zaph and Teadraech both, and slamming them together. The sudden pressure shift was enough to extinguish the fire. Strewn about the ground below where it had been were warped chunks of metal which they recognized as the remnants of those silencing bells Gitash had shown them. Once they had collected themselves and calmed a bit from the fight, Matthias led them downstream following the debtor's trail. The Dead Speak in Flashes \u00b6 After a while, the rapids grew deeper and wider, and the water flowed less violently. They came upon a stone dock with a single boat tied to it, though dragged up onto the stone shore of the cavern. Beyond, they could see a small hut with its door open, light spilling out to meet theirs, revealing a pool of some dark liquid in the doorway. Matthias drew closer to investigate the hut, and found the corpse of a dead trau inside. Based on the amount of blood on the ground and the palor of the corpse, the fellow appeared to have been exsanguinated. Having not learned his lesson last time, he decided to brush up against the veil between life and death in an effort to try and speak with the departed soul of this man. He held in his mind a will to learn anything about the man they followed. He saw a dim vision in his mind of a stranger approaching, though Matthias recognized this stranger as the debtor his church was looking for. The man was heading for a waterfall. The Trau caretaker knew the way, and told him. Matthias noted this in his mind and concentrated his thoughts on what befell the caretaker. Immediately, the vision changed. The stranger pulled out a small clay vial and handed it to the caretaker in thanks before leaving. It was clear that several hours, or perhaps longer, had passed. The caretaker poured the contents of the vial onto the back of his hand, licked a small bit of the powder, then snorted the rest with both nostrils. He sank to the floor as the drug took effect. His last sight before darkness took him was a dark figure with shifting outlines standing in the doorway. He briefly regained consciousness, just long enough to notice he was hanging upside-down. The air was full of the scent of iron, and as he looked up...no, down, he saw a dark pool growing beneath him and his back felt wet. But it was only a moment, and after that, he knew no more. Matthias formulated the feelings and desire for what he really wanted, more about the situation in these watery caves. The spirit showed him a series of flashes in which the caretaker replaced and reset traps, wards, and other protections against the disturbance of the Witch Kings. Someone had been consistently and systematically disabling these protections. He had a sense of some small amount of time passing. Weeks maybe? Matthias thanked the spirit of the Trau and withdrew his consciousness from the veil. He led the group further downstream, and although the river ran through a submerged area the party had to navigate around, Matthias's vision had shown the way. No Quarter \u00b6 The mist from the waterfall hung like dense fog in the air. Although the concussive force of the water crashing down at the bottom of the cliff ahead was a steady rumble in his chest, Matthias heard no sound of it. As he looked down, he saw why. Tom Jenning, the debtor they'd come to collect, was suspended in the mist by ancient gauze wrapped around his throat and limbs. Two guardians pulled his limbs in either direction, clearly intending to pull him apart. Although no sound escaped the aura of the guardians' bells, Jenning's face was contorted in an agonized scream. Uttering a prayer to Maloch, Matthias leapt down. The debts on his skin grew heavy, and he fell faster as they pulled him down. However, just before landing, his burden was lifted just enough to avoid injury as he tackled the righthand guardian. Zaph grumbled about not having fancy gravity powers, and unwound the rope and grapnel from his pack. He quickly rappelled down, though his sprained shoulder gave him some trouble, and he landed slightly off balance. Still resolute, he drew his axe and began fending off the left guardian's tendrils, catching them on the axe and working to tangle it up. He was able to hold it mostly at bay, but in response it reached out still more musty wrappings and began to squeeze his neck, the pressure increasing slowly and constantly. Teadraech, still on the ledge above the falls, drew his bow. He took aim at the cloth ropes tightening around Zaph's throat. As he released the arrow, the dark will behind the black speech in his mind caused his bow arm to twitch just barely, but enough that the arrow sank into Zaph's neck, pinning the cloth wrappings there as well. Meanwhile, down below, Matthias's tattoos began to glow faintly golden as he drew his fist back. Then, with sudden force, he slammed it into where the guardian's face would be if it had one. His divinely imbued fist broke through the shell of magic holding the guardian together, and it immediately imploded around his arm. The bells, warped by the sudden force, left long gashes along his arm, but in his fervor he felt little pain. Zaph was starting to see dark spots dancing before him, and although he was partially obscured by the mist at the base, Teadraech could tell the fighter was in serious trouble. He took a moment to steady himself and drew again, this time aiming for the remaining guardian's head. A tremor came over him at the moment he released, and Jenning's side sprouted a feathered shaft. Matthias ran and leapt at the remaining guardian with a flying boot. It crashed down and skidded across the rough stone floor, its wrappings unraveling. With a silent WHOOMP, it, too, imploded. He hurried over to Zaph. \"Your work is not yet done, your debts not yet repaid,\" he said as he tore the arrow from his throat. He placed his hand over the wound and closed his eyes in prayer to Maloch. Golden light bled between his fingers and when he removed them, a crimson tattoo of sorts lay across the place where the arrow had been. Matthias coughed as a sharp stab of pain struck his own throat. He first expected to be bleeding as he took Zaph's wound onto himself, but instead he found only the raised skin of a nearly identical tattoo to the one Zaph had just gained. Both of them were even more firmly in Maloch's debt. -Fade to black as the party gathered Tom and began making their way hurriedly back toward the surface.-","title":"August 30, 2022"},{"location":"1%20-%20Sessions/2022-08-30/#august-30-2022","text":"","title":"August 30, 2022"},{"location":"1%20-%20Sessions/2022-08-30/#details","text":"","title":"Details"},{"location":"1%20-%20Sessions/2022-08-30/#long-way-down","text":"The party left the burial chamber and its empty sarcophagii and headed down what used to be a staircase, but if there was ever a ceiling it collapsed some time ago.

The air was cold, but there was a constant feeling of being observed, the feeling hot on the back of their necks. After spending a small amount of time investigating the area, they left the burial chamber and its empty sarcophagii and headed down what used to be a staircase. However, if there was ever a ceiling, it collapsed some time ago. The debris and rubble, and missing chunks in the stone stairs, seemed to coroborate that theory. Zaph led the way as the party descended. The deeper the party went, the darker the gloom above seemed, and although they were in a cavernous space, there seemed to be almost no reverberation, as though the stone walls were made of cloth. And suddenly, Gitash and Talgren felt themselves yanked off their feet, hurtling upward into the gloom. The torch Gitash was carrying dropped to the stone without a sound. If they tried to cry out, only the vibration in their throats confirmed that they were doing so. It was as if the world had been put on mute. A hundred feet below or more, they could see their companions looking around in confusion. For a moment it seemed as though Teadraech looked directly at them as they were carried even further away, but then he said something to the others, picked up the alchemical torch, and they began hurrying down the stairs. Soon after that, Gitash and Talgren were dragged into a pitch black tunnel and saw nothing else for a time. They could feel some dusty cloth bandages wrapped firmly around them, a dry linen cocoon holding their limbs in place as they were pulled this way, then that. Perhaps they tried to keep track of the turns in their mind at first, but the turns were many, and came too quickly. They were moving with great speed through the dark and could feel the damp air rushing by their faces. The temperature and ambient smells shifted and changed over time, but the darkness and absolute silence made it nearly impossible to make any proper sense of their surroundings. After what seemed like at least an hour, they saw a circle of light below them. Looking up to where their bonds were held, they saw what appeared to be mummies, faces completely covered in wrappings. Where the eyes would be, a darkness seeped out instead. The things, two of them, clung to the walls and ceiling with animated cloth tentacles. The tendrils in which they were hanging began to elongate, lowering them down toward the light. A circle of cultists stood around a stone figure holding a sword of witchfire in front of it, burning black and drinking in the torchlight. Based on the implements in the room, they were clearly to be sacrificed to this thing. Talgren also recognized tools related to golemetry as well, so it was likely that their souls were to be shattered and imbued into this golem or whatever it was. The guardians released them and hurried back up and away, presumably to pursue the other members of the party. Talgren heard a whisper of recognition pass between two of their captors. It seemed he was known to them. As soon as the guardians were out of sight, Gitash sprung into action, grabbing the foremost enemy and throwing it into the black-fire blade. The dark flames leapt along his robes and in moments, all that was left was a blackened skeleton whose bones were all etched with glowing runes. Talgren followed Gitash's lead and together, they fought clear of the circle and sprinted down a tunnel. As they fled, they toppled ritual paraphernalia and furniture along the way, trying to make it as difficult as possible for their would-be murderers to follow. Some time later, they emerged from the mouth of a cave in the side of the flaming mountain, about half a mile from the gates of Ironwood. They arrived back at the Silvery Orb at nearly the same time as the others. They shared a late dinner as they filled each other in on what had befallen each group. At some point later, they began to discuss the jobs available to them. Talgren brought up the Silver Flame job they'd been kicking down the road for a while and the others agreed that it would be worthwhile to do next. Prologue II: Far Too Many Teeth \u00b6 An angular figure stood silhouetted against the red glow of the night sky. Someone spoke to him, for it did seem to be a masculine form. \"They destroyed three guardians, my lord.\" The figure turned to face the speaker. His eyes shone with an amber light and he smiled, his pale skin stretching taut over his skull. The smile was not a kind smile, far too wide, and there were far too many teeth in it. \"Bring them.\" The other man bowed deeply. \"As you command, master Gray.\" Downtime highlights \u00b6 Gitash worked with parts of the White Hand infrastructure in order to support his clan Teadraech alienated the Green Men by inadvertently letting them see him going into a black speech trance while under the influence of halucinogens Zaph put the party on the Hevlan Trading Company's radar by gambling in their establishment. He was recognized and they were able to tie him back to the scuffle in the temple quarter. Teadraech sought treatment for his curse from the House of Maloch. Their ministrations reduced the volume of the black whispers in his head, but they are still there. He owes Maloch a debt, to be determined later. Gitash hit up the Silver Flame for a skein of extradimensional spider silk so they wouldn't get lost in the Weft. Talgren finished the design work on his alchemical blade Matthias rested up and healed, and then prayed/preached/etc at the House of Maloch The Job - Light the Way \u00b6 Light the Way According to Rhajin, the entrance to the Weft lay deep beneath the ruins of Holgate Academy, near the shores of the Fathomless Mere. The party followed the described route through the long disused sewers beneath Holgate, though an offshoot tunnel and into a cracked cistern. Through the crack, they could see a vast underground cavity. Across from the crack, which they climbed down, stood an ancient building which obviously once looked magnificent, though time (and thieves) had since robbed it of its glory. Its surface was cracked, and covered in chisel marks where precious metal inlays had been removed from the stone. Within the building, the corridors wound ever inward. As they traveled, they began to encounter jagged, lightning-shaped gashes hanging in midair, with endless void barely visible through them - cracks in reality. Eventually they came upon an area where they could not safely skirt around them. Teadraech recalled when he was communing with the old gods of the land something he had interpreted about perspective being important here, and he was certain that the only way to safely pass would be to walk backward through the cracks and it would be safe. For him and the rest of the party, this was true. Zaph's paranoia got the better of him and he decided instead to try and skirt the gashes in reality instead of whatever nonsense everyone else was doing. When he emerged on the other side, it was as though he had been wrapped in these reality breaches. It didn't seem to have any immediately obvious adverse effects but it was certainly worrying. Once beyond the denser patches of damaged reality, they emerged into an ornate chamber, perhaps once a place of worship or gathering. There they found a rival group of delvers, recognizably working for House Caverall, an enemy faction of The Silver Flame. They appeared to be extracting a stone frieze from the wall. Teadraech got into position to fire a warning shot as Gitash approached slowly, hands visibly free of weapons. Talgren followed closely behind, holding the alchemical torch high to shed light, and hopefully blind the other group somewhat. The leader of the other crew stepped forward and exchanged words with Gitash, obviously confrontational and distrusting. Teadraech drew and loosed his arrow, intending to shoot the hat off the leader. However, his concentration was hard to pin down and the shot was a bit short. The rival leader dropped dead on the spot, an arrow in his eye. Talgren saw this happen, and saw the opposing crew readying themselves to retalliate. One of them had his crossbow trained on Gitash, and Talgren threw himself in front of it, raising his sword to fend off any other attackers. By luck, his sword deflected the bolt, but to the rivals, it looked like superhuman reflexes and they were suddenly less inclined to leap into a bloodbath. Matthias stepped forward and unfastened the top of his armor so the tattoos covering his chest would be visible. As they began to glow golden, he spoke out, commanding them to drop their weapons lest their life's debts be called due immediately. They need not die like their leader. < fade to black >","title":"September 7, 2022"},{"location":"1%20-%20Sessions/2022-09-06/#september-7-2022","text":"","title":"September 7, 2022"},{"location":"1%20-%20Sessions/2022-09-06/#prologue-i-sacrifice","text":"In the bowels of ancient ruins of Agartha, the party stood in a burial chamber. The air was cold, but there was a constant feeling of being observed, the feeling hot on the back of their necks. After spending a small amount of time investigating the area, they left the burial chamber and its empty sarcophagii and headed down what used to be a staircase. However, if there was ever a ceiling, it collapsed some time ago. The debris and rubble, and missing chunks in the stone stairs, seemed to coroborate that theory. Zaph led the way as the party descended. The deeper the party went, the darker the gloom above seemed, and although they were in a cavernous space, there seemed to be almost no reverberation, as though the stone walls were made of cloth.
