<h2 id="prologue-i-sacrifice">Prologue I: Sacrifice<a class="headerlink" href="#prologue-i-sacrifice" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the bowels of ancient ruins of Agartha, the party stood in a burial chamber. The air was cold, but there was a constant feeling of being observed, the feeling hot on the back of their necks. After spending a small amount of time investigating the area, they left the burial chamber and its empty sarcophagii and headed down what used to be a staircase.  However, if there was ever a ceiling, it collapsed some time ago. The debris and rubble, and missing chunks in the stone stairs, seemed to coroborate that theory. </p>
<p>Zaph led the way as the party descended. The deeper the party went, the darker the gloom above seemed, and although they were in a cavernous space, there seemed to be almost no reverberation, as though the stone walls were made of cloth. And suddenly, Gitash and Talgren felt themselves yanked off their feet, hurtling upward into the gloom. The torch Gitash was carrying dropped to the stone without a sound. If they tried to cry out, only the vibration in their throats confirmed that they were doing so. It was as if the world had been put on mute.</p>
<p>A hundred feet below or more, they could see their companions looking around in confusion. For a moment it seemed as though Teadraech looked directly at them as they were carried even further away, but then he said something to the others, picked up the alchemical torch, and they began hurrying down the stairs.</p>
<p>Soon after that, Gitash and Talgren were dragged into a pitch black tunnel and saw nothing else for a time. They could feel some dusty cloth bandages wrapped firmly around them, a dry linen cocoon holding their limbs in place as they were pulled this way, then that. Perhaps they tried to keep track of the turns in their mind at first, but the turns were many, and came too quickly. They were moving with great speed through the dark and could feel the damp air rushing by their faces. The temperature and ambient smells shifted and changed over time, but the darkness and absolute silence made it nearly impossible to make any proper sense of their surroundings.</p>
<p>After what seemed like at least an hour, they saw a circle of light below them. Looking up to where their bonds were held, they saw what appeared to be mummies, faces completely covered in wrappings. Where the eyes would be, a darkness seeped out instead. The things, two of them, clung to the walls and ceiling with animated cloth tentacles. The tendrils in which they were hanging began to elongate, lowering them down toward the light.</p>
<p>A circle of cultists stood around a stone figure holding a sword of witchfire in front of it, burning black and drinking in the torchlight. Based on the implements in the room, they were clearly to be sacrificed to this thing. Talgren also recognized tools related to golemetry as well, so it was likely that their souls were to be shattered and imbued into this golem or whatever it was. The guardians released them and hurried back up and away, presumably to pursue the other members of the party. Talgren heard a whisper of recognition pass between two of their captors. It seemed he was known to them.</p>
<p>As soon as the guardians were out of sight, Gitash sprung into action, grabbing the foremost enemy and throwing it into the black-fire blade. The dark flames leapt along his robes and in moments, all that was left was a blackened skeleton whose bones were all etched with glowing runes. Talgren followed Gitash's lead and together, they fought clear of the circle and sprinted down a tunnel. As they fled, they toppled ritual paraphernalia and furniture along the way, trying to make it as difficult as possible for their would-be murderers to follow.</p>
<p>Some time later, they emerged from the mouth of a cave in the side of the flaming mountain, about half a mile from the gates of Ironwood.  They arrived back at the Silvery Orb at nearly the same time as the others. They shared a late dinner as they filled each other in on what had befallen each group.</p>
<p>At some point later, they began to discuss the jobs available to them. Talgren brought up the Silver Flame job they'd been kicking down the road for a while and the others agreed that it would be worthwhile to do next.</p>

<p>An angular figure stood silhouetted against the red glow of the night sky. Someone spoke to him, for it did seem to be a masculine form. "They destroyed three guardians, my lord."</p>
<p>The figure turned to face the speaker. His eyes shone with an amber light and he smiled, his pale skin stretching taut over his skull. The smile was not a kind smile, far too wide, and there were far too many teeth in it. "Bring them."</p>
<p>The other man bowed deeply. "As you command, master Gray."</p>

<li>
<p>Gitash worked with parts of the White Hand infrastructure in order to support his clan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teadraech alienated the Green Men by inadvertently letting them see him going into a black speech trance while under the influence of halucinogens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zaph put the party on the Hevlan Trading Company's radar by gambling in their establishment. He was recognized and they were able to tie him back to the scuffle in the temple quarter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teadraech sought treatment for his curse from the House of Maloch. Their ministrations reduced the volume of the black whispers in his head, but they are still there. He owes Maloch a debt, to be determined later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gitash hit up the Silver Flame for a skein of extradimensional spider silk so they wouldn't get lost in the Weft.</p>

<li>
<p>Talgren finished the design work on his alchemical blade</p>

<p>Matthias rested up and healed, and then prayed/preached/etc at the House of Maloch</p>

<p><a href="../../3%20-%20Jobs/8%20-%20Light%20the%20Way/">Light the Way</a></p>
<p>According to Rhajin, the entrance to the Weft lay deep beneath the ruins of Holgate Academy, near the shores of the Fathomless Mere. The party followed the described route through the long disused sewers beneath Holgate, though an offshoot tunnel and into a cracked cistern. Through the crack, they could see a vast underground cavity. Across from the crack, which they climbed down, stood an ancient building which obviously once looked magnificent, though time (and thieves) had since robbed it of its glory. Its surface was cracked, and covered in chisel marks where precious metal inlays had been removed from the stone.</p>
<p>Within the building, the corridors wound ever inward. As they traveled, they began to encounter jagged, lightning-shaped gashes hanging in midair, with endless void barely visible through them - cracks in reality. Eventually they came upon an area where they could not safely skirt around them.</p>
<p>Teadraech recalled when he was communing with the old gods of the land something he had interpreted about perspective being important here, and he was certain that the only way to safely pass would be to walk backward through the cracks and it would be safe. For him and the rest of the party, this was true.</p>
<p>Zaph's paranoia got the better of him and he decided instead to try and skirt the gashes in reality instead of whatever nonsense everyone else was doing. When he emerged on the other side, it was as though he had been wrapped in these reality breaches. It didn't seem to have any immediately obvious adverse effects but it was certainly worrying.</p>
<p>Once beyond the denser patches of damaged reality, they emerged into an ornate chamber, perhaps once a place of worship or gathering. There they found a rival group of delvers, recognizably working for House Caverall, an enemy faction of The Silver Flame. They appeared to be extracting a stone frieze from the wall.</p>
<p>Teadraech got into position to fire a warning shot as Gitash approached slowly, hands visibly free of weapons. Talgren followed closely behind, holding the alchemical torch high to shed light, and hopefully blind the other group somewhat.  The leader of the other crew stepped forward and exchanged words with Gitash, obviously confrontational and distrusting. </p>
<p>Teadraech drew and loosed his arrow, intending to shoot the hat off the leader. However, his concentration was hard to pin down and the shot was a bit short. The rival leader dropped dead on the spot, an arrow in his eye. Talgren saw this happen, and saw the opposing crew readying themselves to retalliate. One of them had his crossbow trained on Gitash, and Talgren threw himself in front of it, raising his sword to fend off any other attackers. By luck, his sword deflected the bolt, but to the rivals, it looked like superhuman reflexes and they were suddenly less inclined to leap into a bloodbath.</p>
<p>Matthias stepped forward and unfastened the top of his armor so the tattoos covering his chest would be visible. As they began to glow golden, he spoke out, commanding them to drop their weapons lest their life's debts be called due immediately. They need not die like their leader.</p>
